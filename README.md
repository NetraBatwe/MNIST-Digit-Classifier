This project is focussed at classification of 0-9 handwritten digits using MNIST dataset, using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
* The training dataset contains 60,000 handwritten digit images, each of 28x28 pixels.
   * File : train-images.idx3-ubyte
* The labels of these images are stored in seperate file
   * File : train-labels.idx1-ubyte
* The test dataset contains 10,000 handwritten digit images, each of 28x28 pixels.
   * File : t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
* The labels of these test images are stored in seperate file
